# P5R Mementos and Compendium Completion Tracker
<br>
P5R completion tracker was made to help check which personas or mementos requests you're missing. Currently the "base" version of it is up and running, that meaning that all the data is available, there is just no sort and filter function (yet!)

<br/>

Currently aiming for the option to:
- filter the results based on if the checkbox has been ticked
- filter by arcana (ie only seeing the personas beloning to the sun arcana)
- sort the columns by A-Z / Z-A or by level
- filter by path (ie seeing which requests are available in the path of Kaitul)
<br>
Side note: I HIGHLY recommend using P5R Fushion Calculator alongside this! Besides it being helpful for figuring out how to get a certain persona, it also contains extra info about their stats, skills, elementals. All in all, a very useful tool and definitely worth checking out.

## Other plans/ideas

- Add a homepage with some descriptive text and extra info with suggestions to help with overall completion
- Either have the compendium and mementos tables be side by side or have it show the info by selecting on the tab/button
- Make a mobile friendly version
- Light/Dark mode ???
